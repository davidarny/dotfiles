## Installation

Run the `install.sh` script as follows:

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will create symlinks to the dotfiles in your home directory using [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

## Uninstallation

Run the `uninstall.sh` script as follows:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This will remove the symlinks created by the `install.sh` script.
